# Technical Implementation Notes

## Architecture Decisions

### Class Structure
I chose an object-oriented approach because:
- It keeps the code organized and maintainable
- Allows for easy extension of functionality
- Follows WordPress plugin best practices

### AJAX Handling
The dual approach (database + direct content) ensures:
- Reliability if JavaScript content capture fails
- Fresh content when editors haven't been saved
- Fallback mechanisms for different editing environments

### Summary Algorithms
Each style uses a different approach:
1. **First Sentences**: Sequential processing until length limit
2. **Key Points**: Strategic selection from different content sections  
3. **Beginning + Conclusion**: Focus on introductory and concluding thoughts

## Performance Optimizations

- Used `usleep()` instead of `sleep()` for better responsiveness
- Implemented efficient sentence parsing regex
- Added smart truncation that preserves sentence boundaries
- Minimized database queries through strategic meta data storage

## Browser Compatibility

Tested across:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Both Gutenberg and Classic editors
- Mobile and desktop interfaces
